# Rails Application Templates

This repository contains a collection of Rails application templates that I use to start new projects. As of August 2024, there is but one template: 
`base_template.rb`.

## `base_template.rb`

This template sets up a new Rails application with the following features:

* Controllers for authentication and user registration
* A basic user model
* A basic user authentication system
* A basic user registration system
* A basic session system
* PWA support: service-worker.js, manifest.json, and a base application.js file
* The JavaScript application file relies on Alpine.js, Trix, and ActionText
* When running this template, do not overwrite `.rubocop.yml`, `app/javascript/application.js` or `config/importmap.rb`
